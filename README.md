Got it! Hereâ€™s the updated `README.md` file without the configuration section:

# express-log

A middleware function for Express.js that mimics Laravel's `dd()` function. This package helps you log and inspect variables easily during development.

## Features

- Simple and easy-to-use middleware.
- Mimics Laravel's `dd()` function for debugging.
- Outputs JSON and console logs.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install express-log
```

## Usage

### Normal Console Logging

Typically, you might log variables in an Express.js application like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 };
  console.log(user); // Logs the user object to the console
  res.send('Check your console for logged variables!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Using `express-log`

To use `express-log` in your Express.js application, follow these steps:

1. Import the package and use it as middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const expressLog = require('express-log');

const app = express();

// Use express-log middleware
app.use(expressLog);

// Your routes here
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 };
  res.log(user); // Uses express-log to log the user object
  res.send('Check your console for logged variables!');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

2. The `express-log` middleware will log variables to the console when a request is made.
